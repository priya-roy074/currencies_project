# FinTech_PriyaRoy
My name is Priya Roy and I currently work at PwC as a global structuring associate within the international tax group.
I hope to explore more finance and technology driven work and find improving operational efficiencies and automatinh processes very exciting. 
Through this class I am hopeful I will be able to execute the ideas I have to modify inefficient workflows and systems in my everyday work.
